# Confetti Calculator

## Objective:

The goal of this assignment is to assess your front-end development skills, state management, and
ability to replicate the sophisticated UI&UX using React.
You are required to build a web-based clone of the macOS Scientific Calculator using React. The
calculator should include all basic arithmetic operations, advanced functions like trigonometry,
logarithms, exponents, and special functions (e.g., factorial, random number). The UI should exactly look
like the following des

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```
https://github.com/chintu46306/confetti-calculator.git      

```

2. Install dependencies:

```
npm install

```

3. Start the development server:

```
npm start

```

# Usage
## Basic Arithmetic
Use the calculator buttons to perform basic arithmetic operations. The display will show the current input and results.

## Advanced Functions
To use functions like x^2, x^3, e^x, etc., simply click the corresponding button after entering the number.
For trigonometric functions, toggle between degrees and radians using the "Rad" button.

## Scientific Notation
To enter numbers in scientific notation, use the "EE" button. For example, to input 1.23 x 10^4, press 1, ., 2, 3, EE.

## Memory Functions
MC: Clears the memory.
MR: Recalls the number stored in memory.
M+: Adds the current display value to the memory.
M-: Subtracts the current display value from the memory.
